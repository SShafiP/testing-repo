This is a test document. Use this document for testing the Git system. This document can also be used for storing useful info
about git (I really hate this git thing!).

Basic workflow:

Start a git repo by opening a terminal (e.g. Powershell or Command prompt) at a particular directory that
you want to be the repo. Then type the command "git init".

Create files. Then add them to the git Staging Area using the command "git add <file name>". You can also
add all files using "git add .".

Commit this change using "git commit -m "<Commit message>"".

Modify those files. Then again add them by "git add <file name>" (or "git add .").

Then commit this change again using "git commit -m "<Commit message>"".

One way to add both a title and a description to a commit message from the command line:
git commit -m "Title" -m "Description ..........";

Switch to a particular version of a file:
git checkout <commit-hash> <filename>

This is also good: git checkout <commit-tag> <filename>
For example: git checkout Bismillah Notes.txt

Note that if I jump to another version like this, this jumping is itself a change, and it can also be committed.

If the "git log" or "git status" (or any other message-displaying command) is multi-page and fills out the entire terminal,
press "q" to quit that display and get back to command line in that terminal.


Example of a 3-way merge:
# Start a new feature
git checkout -b new-feature main
# Edit some files
git add <file>
git commit -m "Start a feature"
# Edit some files
git add <file>
git commit -m "Finish a feature"
# Develop the main branch
git checkout main
# Edit some files
git add <file>
git commit -m "Make some super-stable changes to main"
# Merge in the new-feature branch
git merge new-feature
git branch -d new-feature
